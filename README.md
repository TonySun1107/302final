# Impact of Water Conditions on Dissolved Oxygen Level from 1989 to 2019

## Overview

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of key water quality parameters—dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, and pH—within aquatic environments. It focuses on how temperature, salinity, and pH affect dissolved oxygen levels, which are crucial for assessing water quality. The findings indicate that increases in temperature and salinity are linked to decreased oxygen availability, highlighting the negative impacts these factors have on aquatic ecosystems. This research not only sheds light on the complex interactions among these environmental determinants but also offers valuable insights for managing and preserving aquatic ecosystems, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.

We examine data about Water Quality and the data is obtained from [Water Quality Data](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/117348).


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw and cleaned data.
-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from  [Water Quality Data](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/117348).
-   `data/cleaned_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
