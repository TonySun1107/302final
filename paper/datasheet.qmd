abstract: "This data set contains water quality monitoring records at multiple measurement points since 1994. The main measurement parameters include salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH value, transparency, water temperature and air temperature, aiming to monitor and evaluate changes in environmental water quality. The data are obtained through regular sampling and cover a wide range of time spans and locations, providing important long-term data resources for studying water environment health and ecological changes. These data can be used for environmental science research, policy development, and to promote sustainable water resources management."

Extract of the questions from @US2019datasheet.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - This dataset was created to analyze water quality in the United States. We were unable to find a publicly available dataset in a structured format that contained the water quality criteria values needed for modeling.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - U.S Department of the Interior
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - None
4. *Any other comments?*
    - None

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- This dataset represents a combination of environmental measurement instances, taken at different times and potentially different locations, focusing on water quality metrics. The presence of multiple types of measurements (like water temperature, air temperature, pH, etc.) suggests a detailed tracking of environmental conditions over time. 
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- One
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset does not contain all possible instances, it is a sample of instances from a larger set. A larger set is the various indicators of water quality. The sample is not representative of the larger collection.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- The original data includes the year, month and day of the time, water salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, water depth, water temperature and air temperature.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- None
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Data that did not meet the requirements or that seriously did not meet the requirements were processed before the start of the study.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Relationships between individual instances have been clarified, with a direct negative correlation between dissolved oxygen content and temperature in the same waters. An increase in temperature results in a decrease in dissolved oxygen content.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- The data used in this study is already clear and neat and data splitting is not recommended.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The first step at the beginning of the study for the presence of errors in the dataset is to clean and analyze the obtained dataset.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- Data sets are self-contained, ensuring that these resources exist and remain unchanged over timeã€‚
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset does not contain data that may be considered confidential.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- The data set does not contain the above factors.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The dataset is age-identified.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The data set does not contain the above factors.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- None

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
